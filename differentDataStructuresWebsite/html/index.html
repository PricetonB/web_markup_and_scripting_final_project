    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>
        Welcome to our platform, dedicated to enhancing your comprehension of various data structures.
        Our content delves into essential topics, including linked lists, hashmaps, trees, and graphs.
        A foundational understanding of object-oriented code design and coding principles is recommended
        for optimal engagement. All code presented on this site is implemented in Python, ensuring a 
        consistent and comprehensive learning experience.</p>

    <h2>Linked List</h2>
    <p>
        A linked list is a linear data structure consisting of nodes, where each node points to the next one
        in the sequence. It provides dynamic memory allocation and efficient insertion or removal of elements,
        making it versatile for various applications in computer science.
        </p>
    
    <h2>Hashmap</h2>
    <p>
        A hashmap, or hash table, is a data structure that enables efficient data retrieval by using a
        key-value pair mapping. It employs a hash function to index the elements, allowing rapid insertion,
        deletion, and retrieval operations. Hashmaps are widely used for their constant-time average
        complexity for basic operations.</p>
    
    <h2>Tree</h2>
    <p>
        A tree is a hierarchical data structure with a root node and branches that lead to leaves.
        Each node in a tree can have child nodes, forming a structure that is particularly useful for 
        representing hierarchical relationships. Trees are employed in various algorithms and databases
        for efficient data organization and search operations.
    </p>
    
    <h2>Graph</h2>
    <p>
        A graph is a collection of nodes connected by edges, where each edge represents a relationship between
        the nodes. Graphs can be directed or undirected and are essential for modeling complex relationships
        and networks. They find applications in various domains, including social networks, transportation
        systems, and algorithm design.
